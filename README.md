# Profit Decline in Corporate Segment (RevoShion)

## SECTION 1: PROJECT SUMMARY FOR PORTFOLIO
### Summary/Context
This project investigates a -13.6% profit decline within RevoShion’s Corporate segment, despite a +20.4% growth in total sales. While Consumer and Home Office segments saw strong growth, the Corporate sector suffered from margin erosion. This analysis identifies root causes—specifically high discount rates and shipping costs—to provide a data-driven roadmap for restoring segment profitability.

### Goals
The primary goal is to identify the root causes of margin erosion in the Corporate segment and develop strategies to restore profitability. The project aims to balance financial optimization, such as pricing and logistics, with strategic enablers like customer loyalty and product renewal. Ultimately, it seeks to ensure both short-term financial recovery and long-term competitive advantage.

### Process
The analysis utilized a Tableau dashboard to track Sales, Profit, and Orders across segments and states. Data exploration revealed that the Corporate segment had the highest average discount (18%) and significant shipping costs. The process involved segmenting performance by region, identifying high-loss categories like Tables, and developing an action plan using Account-Based Marketing (ABM) strategies.

### Output
Analysis identified that excessive discounting and high logistics costs for heavy items were the primary drivers of the -13.6% profit decline. Recommendations include implementing Account-Based Marketing for 100 top corporate accounts, shifting 40% of the budget to LinkedIn Ads, and renegotiating logistics contracts. These integrated strategies are expected to contribute +Rp500M in quarterly revenue through higher-quality B2B leads.

## SECTION 2: SCOPE OF WORK / ACHIEVEMENTS (AQS FRAMEWORK)
Diagnosed a -13.6% profit decline in the Corporate segment by analyzing sales growth versus margin erosion across three business segments.

Identified high average discount rates of 18% as a primary driver of loss, leading to a recommendation to cap discounts at 10%.

Developed a B2B recovery plan proposing a 40% budget shift to LinkedIn Ads to target 100 high-value corporate accounts.

Analyzed logistics data to reveal that shipping costs for heavy items like Tables significantly impacted the bottom line.
